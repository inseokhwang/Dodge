Dodge - A short avoid the falling blizzard style game.
Author - Inseok Hwang

What works:
	Basic object movements
	Framework
	Compiling
	Game over scenario

What doesn't work:
	Main/Menu screen
	Restart button
	Main character movement - coming up next.

How to run:

	Desktop - Simply run the main.java on Dodge-desktop.
		  I'll compile the jar file later when I feel like it.

	Android - Simply run the MainActivity.java. Since I haven't set the game to have adjustable resoultion, the game might have an awkward resolution. Will fix this later too.

	Any other platform - Haven't tested as of yet.
