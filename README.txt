Dodge - A short avoid the falling blizzard style game.
Author - Inseok Hwang

What works:
	Basic object movements
	Framework
	Compiling
	Correct screen resolution display

What doesn't work:
	Main/Menu screen
	Restart button

How to run:

	Android - Simply run the MainActivity.java. Since I haven't set the game to have adjustable resoultion, the game might have an awkward resolution. Will fix this later too.

	Desktop - Will require some method restructuring. Will work on it later.
	
	Any other platform - Haven't tested as of yet.
